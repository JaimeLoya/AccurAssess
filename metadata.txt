#----------------------Take into account
#The difference between both plugins is that Accuracy Assessment only process the raw matrix and does not take into account the sampling design used to select the reference data.
#AccurAssess carries out a correction of bias of sampling before computing the accuracy indices (Method of Card 1982).
#In brief, Accuracy Assessment will only give correct indices if the number of reference sample by class is proportional to the area of each class on the map 
#(e.g. simple random or systematic sampling but not in case of stratified sampling except the rare case of a stratification which respects these proportions). 
#AccurAssess correct the bias of sampling and will give correct results with simple random and stratified sampling.
#Additionally, AccurAssess give the confidence intervals (CI) around the estimates of accuracy indices and gives corrected estimates of class area (also with CI).
